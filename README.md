# INTEGRATE: model-based multi-omics data integration to characterize multi-level metabolic regulation

![](images/workflow.png)

## Overview
The study of metabolism and its regulation is finding increasing application in various fields, including health, wellness, and biotransformations. Complete characterization of regulatory mechanisms controlling metabolism requires knowledge of metabolic fluxes, whose direct determination lags behind other omic technologies, such as metabolomics and transcriptomics. In isolation, these methodologies do not allow accurate characterization of metabolic regulation. Hence, there is a need for integrated methodologies to disassemble the interdependence between different regulatory layers controlling metabolism.
To this aim, we propose a computational pipeline to characterize the landscape of metabolic regulation in different biological samples. The method integrates intracellular and extracellular metabolomics, and transcriptomics, using constraint-based stoichiometric metabolic models as a scaffold. We compute differential reaction expression from transcriptomic data and use constraint-based modeling to predict if the differential expression of metabolic enzymes directly originates differences in metabolic fluxes. In parallel, using metabolomic data, we predict how differences in substrate availability translate into differences in metabolic fluxes. By intersecting these two output datasets, we discriminate fluxes regulated at the metabolic and/or transcriptional level. This information is valuable to better inform targeted action planning in different fields, including personalized prescriptions in multifactorial diseases, such as cancer, and metabolic engineering.
